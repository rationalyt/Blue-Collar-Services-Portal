Blue-collar jobs require manual labour and their services can be hired by anyone. The purpose of the project is to develop an IRS (Information Retrieval System) for all manual services required by the common man in his day to day life.

 The project provides selfemployment to the workers and renders services to the user. Working on this project gives us a better experience that can be used in developing real time projects in coming future. Various phases of this project involve sample databases with several tables having information about electricians, plumbers, gardeners, masons, painters, carpenters, tailors and garage services. We will be developing a standard web page that is linked to the databases to retrieve authenticated worker information which can be viewed by the users. Users can also give feedback of workers based on their performance. Based on the feedback, admin can either revoke or retain the services of a worker.
